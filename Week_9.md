Adjust zoom regions for channel maps --> estimate SkyCoord and convert to pixel coordinates with `skycoord_to_pixel`.

> x-axis boundary: RA = 16h 57m 20.4s, RA = 16h 57m 18.8s

> y-axis boundary: Dec = -16d 09m 30s, Dec = -16d 09m 08s

Remove axes labels and tick labels in preparation for channel map assembly. 

Locally download all individual figures to configure in Inkscape.
