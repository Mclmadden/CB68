Plan to re-measure P.A. of outflow? Imai et al. (2022) took P.A. = 142° from Wu et al. (1996) and Valée et al. (2000). 

[Dunham et al. (2014)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...783...29D/abstract) use P.A. = 135° for CB68 in Table 5, which was measured "by hand with a prototractor as the angle east of north." 

Compare the two position angles against CCH map --> Dunham et al. appears to fit the contours better.

Mix and match moment 0 maps and contours, starting with molecular tracers SiO, c-C3H2, H2CO, CH3OH, C18O, SO, CS, CCH.
