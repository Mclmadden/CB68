### Monday 3/6

Plan to re-measure P.A. of outflow? Imai et al. (2022) took P.A. = 142° from Wu et al. (1996) and Valée et al. (2000). 

[Dunham et al. (2014)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...783...29D/abstract) use P.A. = 135° for CB68 in Table 5, which was measured "by hand with a prototractor as the angle east of north." 

Compare the two position angles against CCH map --> Dunham et al. appears to fit the contours better.

Mix and match moment 0 maps and contours, starting with molecular tracers SiO, c-C3H2, H2CO, CH3OH, C18O, SO, CS, CCH. 

### Tuesday 3/7

Add black and red labels to indicate moment map and contour tracers respectively.

Disk(?) doesn't align when comparing most tracers to CCH and C18O disks. 

Look into obtaining the new data to plug into the PV diagram script --> large files to copy over to lustre and download locally?
