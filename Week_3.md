For consistency's sake with Imai and Oya papers, find way to have Offset in PV diagrams to center at 0".

Look into `pvextractor.PathFromCenter(SkyCoord center, lenght of path, position angle)` --> initial plotting continues to place offset 0" at the origin. Manually center?

Difficulty plotting path over map using `get_xy(wcs)` because of conversion from SkyCoords to pixels.
