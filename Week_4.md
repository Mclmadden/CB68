Script works on archive data with adjustments to frequency/velocity slice and `set_aspect`.

Sent examples of CCH, CS, and SO PV diagrams to PIs --> asked about creating PV diagrams along the outflow axis (P.A. = 142Â°) simply by swapping out `PathFromCenter` variable.

Roundabout method to rewrite the axes labels in order to center the Angular Offset but possible easier solution. 

Issues with NM gygax system requiring maintenance throughout the day.
