### Monday 2/13

Script works on archive data with adjustments to frequency/velocity slice and `set_aspect`.

Look into methods to overwrite the `imshow` axes to center the angular offset at the outflow center coordinates. 

`extent` parameter of `imshow` basing arguments off of pixel/index? --> not behaving as expected

### Tuesday 2/14 

Sent examples of CCH, CS, and SO PV diagrams to PIs --> asked about creating PV diagrams along the outflow axis (P.A. = 142Â°) simply by swapping out `PathFromCenter` variable.

Roundabout method to rewrite the axes labels in order to center the Angular Offset but possible easier solution. 

Issues with NM gygax system requiring maintenance throughout the day. 

### Wednesday 2/15

Ask about "inelegant" axes overwriting solution as a temporary fix? 

Difficulty tracing axes back to `imshow` using data created from `pvextractor.extract_pv_slice`.
