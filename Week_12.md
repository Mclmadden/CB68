### Monday 4/10

Inspect modeling scripts.

Schedule meeting with eDisk collaborator to discuss their data next week.

Busy schedule with PPVII this week in Japan.

### Tuesday 4/11

Meeting with PI

> Work on scheduling meetings with collaborators to discuss modeling 

> Leave outflow modeling to collaborators

> Shift focus to streamer modeling 

> Closer inspection of "J-shape" seen in channel maps

> Re-grid with `spectral_interpolate` method in spectral cube

> Trace J-shape and overlay onto combined channel maps over a small velocity range 

### Wednesday 4/12 

Set `spectral_slab` range for all cubes to 3.80 - 4.65 km/s to produce 6 channels.

Re-grid the other 6 molecular tracers to CS's spectral axis using `spectral_interpolate`.
