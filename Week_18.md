### Monday 5/22

Sent FITS file examples of CS PV diagrams made 1.0" from protostar at both P.A. to PI.

Determine vmin/vmax for each row in PV diagram grids, i.e. every 4 panels.

Assemble remaining PV diagram grids (made perpendicular to outflow axis P.A. = 165째) in Inkscape, and upload figures to Overleaf draft. 

Create CS PV diagram grid made perpendicular to outflow axis P.A. = 135째 as example --> features drift leftward at increasing offset. 

### Tuesday 5/23 

No meeting with PI.

Continue working on 135째 PV diagrams?

### Wednesday 5/24

No meeting with PI.

Determine vmin/vmax for next batch of PV diagram rows per molecular tracer. 

### Thursday 5/25 

Produce 135째 perpendicular PV diagrams.

Start assembling new batch of grids in Inkscape. 

### Friday 5/26
