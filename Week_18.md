### Monday 5/22

Sent FITS file examples of CS PV diagrams made 1.0" from protostar at both P.A. to PI.

Determine vmin/vmax for each row in PV diagram grids, i.e. every 4 panels.

Assemble remaining PV diagram grids (made perpendicular to outflow axis P.A. = 165°) in Inkscape, and upload figures to Overleaf draft. 

Create CS PV diagram grid made perpendicular to outflow axis P.A. = 135° as example --> features drift leftward at increasing offset.
